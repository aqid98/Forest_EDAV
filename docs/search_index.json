[["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values First lets check which of the three columns have missing values. ## 0 ## 0 ## 537 Thus the third column that is Value has 537 missing values. Now lets see which countries have these. ## Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Belgium Belgium-Luxembourg ## Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba Bosnia and Herzegovina Channel Islands ## China, Hong Kong SAR China, Macao SAR China, Taiwan Province of Croatia ## CuraÃ§ao Czechia Czechoslovakia Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Ethiopia PDR Georgia ## Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Marshall Islands ## Micronesia (Federated States of) Montenegro North Macedonia ## Northern Mariana Islands Pacific Islands Trust Territory Palau ## Republic of Moldova Russian Federation Saint-Martin (French part) Serbia ## Serbia and Montenegro Sint Maarten (Dutch part) Slovakia Slovenia South Sudan ## Sudan Sudan (former) Tajikistan Turkmenistan Ukraine USSR Uzbekistan ## Yugoslav SFR Now comes the historical context to these missing values. Countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan came into existence in 1991 so have data missing for 1991. Similarly the Soviet Union broke into 15 sovereign states. All 15 of which are in the above list. Other countries also follow the same logic. South Sudan came into existence in 2011. For the time being we shall delete these countries as they dont affect our comparisons much. "]]
