There are a lot of factors which cause deforestation such as mining, desertification, logging, forest fires etc. The aim behind this project to explore which countries are facing deforestation and which ones are facing afforestation and try to answer a few questions around them using data exploration and visualization. Deforestation leads to loss of biodiversity and extinction of a lot of species of plants and animals. Countries clear forests mostly for economic purpose. There is an intuition that more the forest land cleared for economic activities, better should be the economy of the country. Is this always true? 1.0.2 Questions of interest: In order to streamline our project with some use case we have decided to try and answer few of the following questions. Is the rate of deforestation actually alarming or are countries balancing it. (One country cuts n number of trees and at the same time some country plants n number of trees)? It is long assumed that more industrialization leads to more deforestation. Can this be proved using the global deforestation dataset and GDP data sets? Do rich and poor countries imply more deforestation. Does recession affect deforestation? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources In this project we use the following two data sets. Global Deforestation 1990-2021: Source: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Link: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GF GDP Growth Rate: Source: The World Bank Link: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG Both these are open source datasets which can be taken in csv format. Since we have to compare the effects of the two datasets we have decided the time line 1990-2019 since these are the years common to both datasets and easy to process. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Extraction 3.2 Transformation 3.3 Loading (Cleaning)", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Extraction The datasets that we have downloaded from their respective sites have a lot of columns, many of which are not needed for this project. ## ï..Domain.Code ## Domain ## Area.Code ## Area ## Element.Code ## Element ## Item.Code ## Item ## Year.Code ## Year ## Unit ## Value ## Flag ## Flag.Description The columns for the Forest Land dataset look like this: ï..Domain.Code Domain Area.Code Area Element.Code Element Item.Code chr chr int chr int chr int Item Year.Code Year Unit Value Flag Flag.Description chr int int chr num chr chr 3.2 Transformation On randomly plotting a scatter plot of forest area for the top countries by area. That is Russia Canada China US Brazil Australia India Argentina Kazakhstan Algeria On plotting the above 10 plots we get The above graphs due to their large differences are difficult to infer hence we plot these individually. The Russian Federation came into existence in 1992 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, hence the first few rows have no data. This will also be kept in mind during the data cleaning process. On observing the scatter plot we can see that Russia has the best afforestation rate. It is also one of the highest forested countries. Area Year Value 5493 Russian Federation 1992 809013.6 5494 Russian Federation 1993 809045.5 5495 Russian Federation 1994 809077.3 5496 Russian Federation 1995 809109.2 Canada has shown a significant decrease in the forest land in a very linear fashion.

Area Year Value 1321 China 1990 157140.6 1322 China 1991 159126.6 1323 China 1992 161112.6 1324 China 1993 163098.6 1325 China 1994 165084.6 1326 China 1995 167070.6 From 1990-2000 the United States of America shows a steady increase in the total forest area. Post 2000 to 2015 there is a huge rise. Following which the rate stabilizes.

Post 2010 Australia planted huge amounts of trees included on land cleared for mining. Thus Australia shows an increase in the total forest land.

Post 2000 Algeria shows an increase in the total forest land. This happened due to the launch of National Reforestation Plan in 2000.

We shall load these values into our original data. Also in order to make sense of our data we shall add historical contexts to each operation that we perform and every anomaly that we obtain. These steps will be discussed in further chapters. 3.3.1 Loading Columns For the forest area dataset we only need the country, year and value. Thus we only keep these Columns and discard the rest. We also renamed Area to Country which was not making any sense in the original data. 3.3.2 Alpha-3 ISO Coding For plotting on map, D3 matches the countrys ISO-3 code instead of matching the label or country name. Hence we shall add another column ID by merging the data using wikipedias list. (https://gist.github.com/radcliff/f09c0f88344a7fcef373) "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values First lets check which of the three columns have missing values. ## 0 ## 0 ## 537 Thus the third column that is Value has 537 missing values. 4.0.1 Countries with missing values Now lets see which countries have these. ## Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Belgium-Luxembourg, ## Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Channel Islands, ## China, Hong Kong SAR, China, Macao SAR, China, Taiwan Province of, Croatia, ## CuraÃ§ao, Czechia, Czechoslovakia, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia PDR, ## Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, ## Marshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated States of), Montenegro, North Macedonia, ## Northern Mariana Islands, Pacific Islands Trust Territory, Palau, ## Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, Saint-Martin (French part), Serbia, ## Serbia and Montenegro, Sint Maarten (Dutch part), Slovakia, Slovenia, ## South Sudan, Sudan, Sudan (former), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, USSR, ## Uzbekistan, Yugoslav SFR 4.0.2 Historical Context Now comes the historical context to these missing values. Countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan came into existence in 1991 so have data missing for 1991. Similarly the Soviet Union broke into 15 sovereign states. All 15 of which are in the above list. Other countries also follow the same logic. South Sudan came into existence in 2011. For the time being we shall delete these countries as they dont affect our comparisons much. Even countries which broke into two separate countries have missing values for one of them. Countries which get annexed by other countries will also show an increase or decrease in overall forest land. For instance Israel keeps annexing some Palestine territory in the West Bank every 2 years or so or the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. 4.0.3 Irregularities Countries such as Kuwait record their forest land area change every 5 years while other countries record it annually. This leads to a few missing values. In order to deal with these we take the most recent values for these years. This allows us to deal with the change in forest area efficiently. As change is 0 in such cases we can keep these countries aside and focus on those with a high rate of deforestation.
