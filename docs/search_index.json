That is Russia Canada China US Brazil Australia India Argentina Kazakhstan Algeria On plotting the above 10 plots we get The above graphs due to their large differences are difficult to infer hence we plot these individually. The Russian Federation came into existence in 1992 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, hence the first few rows have no data. This will also be kept in mind during the data cleaning process. On observing the scatter plot we can see that Russia has the best afforestation rate. It is also one of the highest forested countries. Area Year Value 5493 Russian Federation 1992 809013.6 5494 Russian Federation 1993 809045.5 5495 Russian Federation 1994 809077.3 5496 Russian Federation 1995 809109.2 Canada has shown a significant decrease in the forest land in a very linear fashion. Area Year Value 1141 Canada 1990 348272.9 1142 Canada 1991 348225.8 1143 Canada 1992 348178.7 1144 Canada 1993 348131.6 1145 Canada 1994 348084.5 1146 Canada 1995 348037.5 Similar to Russia, China has also shown a healthy reforestation rate. Area Year Value 1321 China 1990 157140.6 1322 China 1991 159126.6 1323 China 1992 161112.6 1324 China 1993 163098.6 1325 China 1994 165084.6 1326 China 1995 167070.6 From 1990-2000 the United States of America shows a steady increase in the total forest area. Post 2000 to 2015 there is a huge rise. Following which the rate stabilizes. Area Year Value 7021 United States of America 1990 302450.0 7022 United States of America 1991 302558.6 7023 United States of America 1992 302667.2 7024 United States of America 1993 302775.8 7025 United States of America 1994 302884.4 7026 United States of America 1995 302993.0 From 1990-2010 Brazil shows a steep deforestation rate which continues further till 2020. Area Year Value 871 Brazil 1990 588898.0 872 Brazil 1991 585117.1 873 Brazil 1992 581336.1 874 Brazil 1993 577555.2 875 Brazil 1994 573774.2 876 Brazil 1995 569993.3 Up-to 2010 Australia was a global deforestation center. Post 2010 Australia planted huge amounts of trees included on land cleared for mining. Thus Australia shows an increase in the total forest land. Area Year Value 331 Australia 1990 133882.2 332 Australia 1991 133675.4 333 Australia 1992 133468.6 334 Australia 1993 133261.8 335 Australia 1994 133055.0 336 Australia 1995 132848.1 Like China, India shows a healthy afforestation rate. Area Year Value 3091 India 1990 63938.0 3092 India 1991 64303.3 3093 India 1992 64668.6 3094 India 1993 65033.9 3095 India 1994 65399.2 3096 India 1995 65764.5 Argentina shows a heavy deforestation rate. Area Year Value 241 Argentina 1990 35204.0 242 Argentina 1991 35021.4 243 Argentina 1992 34838.8 244 Argentina 1993 34656.2 245 Argentina 1994 34473.6 246 Argentina 1995 34291.0 Kazakhstan shows a trend similar to Australia where in there is a reverse trend post 2010. Kazakhstan initiated artificial forestation from 2010. Area Year Value 3451 Kazakhstan 1990 NA 3452 Kazakhstan 1991 NA 3453 Kazakhstan 1992 3161.181 3454 Kazakhstan 1993 3160.649 3455 Kazakhstan 1994 3160.117 3456 Kazakhstan 1995 3159.585 Up-to 2000 Algeria had an alarming rate of loss of forest land. Post 2000 Algeria shows an increase in the total forest land. This happened due to the launch of National Reforestation Plan in 2000. Area Year Value 61 Algeria 1990 1667.0 62 Algeria 1991 1658.2 63 Algeria 1992 1649.4 64 Algeria 1993 1640.6 65 Algeria 1994 1631.8 66 Algeria 1995 1623.0 3.3 Loading (Cleaning) Since the json object in a D3 map requires Country ID in ISO-Alpha 3 scale. We shall load these values into our original data. Also in order to make sense of our data we shall add historical contexts to each operation that we perform and every anomaly that we obtain. These steps will be discussed in further chapters. 3.3.1 Loading Columns For the forest area dataset we only need the country, year and value. Thus we only keep these Columns and discard the rest. We also renamed Area to Country which was not making any sense in the original data. "]]
